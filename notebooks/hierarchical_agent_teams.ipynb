    "\n",
    "InvestIQ is an Agentic AI that combines stock market analysis, news analysis, and knowledge from document sources to provide insights. It uses a combination of 4 agents with different roles to provide insights. \n",

    "Project Github Repo Link - https://github.com/Nishchal-dl/InvestIQ\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stock Market Agent\n",
    "2. News Agent\n",
    "3. RAG Agent\n",
    "4. Formatting Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these agents are part of a hierarchical agent team and is coordinated by a supervisor agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervisor Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The supervisor agent coordinates the hierarchical agent team and directs flow of execution. It decides which agent to invoke based on the user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stock Market Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The stock market agent provides insights about a stock ticker. This agent uses a tool (Yahoo Finance –  yfinance ) to fetch stock market data and provides details about the stock. The agent only provides necessary details about the stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "### News Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The news agent provides summary of news articles related to the stock ticker. It uses a tool (NewsAPI) to fetch news articles and provides details about the news articles. This also provides sentiments around the news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG agent provides data from document sources. This agent uses the vectoe embedding and search to fetch relevant document chunks when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The formatting agent formats the data gathered by the other agents and provides a final response to the user. This agent does not use any external tools. This agent can be used to summarize the data gathered by the other agents. In this perticular use case we are formatting the data to a JSON format.\n",
